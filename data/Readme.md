## You can create folders just like in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SqLu6v6bxBrmQt67ledKSBJYrxqpCsaF?usp=drive_link)

Each folder contains files described below:

* data processed
  
  These are the data that have been preprocessed using humanize_preprocess.py and tapify_preprocess.py.

* inference
  
  These are the results of running inference on the actual test dataset, as well as MIDI files used to experiment with bass2drum.

* midi_data
  
  You can download the Groove MIDI Dataset (GMD) from the following link : <https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/groove>
